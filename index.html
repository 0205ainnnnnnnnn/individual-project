        The success and results of  this task required a lot of guidance and support from many people. I was very lucky to receive this while completing the work. Whatever I've been doing, I owe this guidance and support, and I never forget to thank the people who have helped me.

        I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who gave me the opportunity to complete this asingment. My lecturer Sir Faizal Haini Hanafi for giving me the opportunity to complete this task and for giving me all the support and guidance that allowed me to complete the task on time. I  would also like to thank all those who have guided me, directly and indirectly. Many people, especially my classmates, gave me valuable comments on my work, which inspired me to improve the quality of my work.
